👋 Hi, I'm **Giuseppe**,

a master's degree computer engineering student. 


My greatest passions are two: **computer science** and **engineering** in the sense of creation, development and desire to get involved and music, from the view of a guitarist as I am. 
These fit perfectly with my desire to do, to obtain satisfaction in achieving the set goals.


“For everything there is a solution , if it is not there, develops it!”
